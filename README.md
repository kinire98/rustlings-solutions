# Rustlings solutions
These are my solutions to the rustlings exercises.  
These are probably *not* the best solutions for the exercises but they work, 
for some of them I really needed help, but, hey, it's finished: 
![Rustlings exercises finished](./finished.jpg)
For reference purposes, I have finished them on 11/08/2023 (English speaking countries) or 08/11/2023 (Spanish speaking countries)
## Suggestions, changes, etc.
Any doubt, suggestion or change you want to make or ask me something, open an issue or a PR, I will try to answer them
